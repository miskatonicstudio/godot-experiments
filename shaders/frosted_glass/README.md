This shader uses a normalmap texture to distort the view and create a frosted glass effect. The repo provides 2 textures: a .png file (created using Blender) and an instance of NoiseTexture2D (built into Godot Engine).

The day environment HDRI is in public domain and can be downloaded from [ambientCG](https://ambientcg.com/view?id=DayEnvironmentHDRI030).

A pixelated 3D scanner effect, heavily inspired by Cyberpunk 2077. It uses a separate camera and additional visibility / render layers to create an overlay. There are 2 MeshInstance3D nodes in the scene, to show the difference between scannable and non-scannable objects.

The cryopod model was created for the game [Intrepid](https://github.com/miskatonicstudio/intrepid) and is in public domain.
